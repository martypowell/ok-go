# Notes for learning Go

Using https://gobyexample.com/

- strconv function names aren't neccessarily intuitive example [int to string](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#Itoa)
- What variable syntax is perferred in go seems like shorthand `:=`
- Need to read more about pointers, when do we use them?, flags uses pointers
