# Notes for learning Go

Using https://gobyexample.com/

- strconv function names aren't neccessarily intuitive example [int to string](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#Itoa)
- What variable syntax is perferred in go seems like shorthand `:=`
- Need to read more about pointers, when do we use them?, flags uses pointers
- Need to figure out best way to make local modules, see https://golang.org/doc/code.html, also see this which happened to work https://stackoverflow.com/a/27890996
- The second suggestion above seems mysterious to me, but seems like main serves as a namespace
